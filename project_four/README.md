# AWS Cloud Project Four

Implementing a web (MEAN) stack on AWS. Our goal is to implement a simple Book Register web form using MEAN stack.


MEAN Stack is a combination of following components:

MongoDB (Document database) – Stores and allows to retrieve data.
Express (Back-end application framework) – Makes requests to Database for Reads and Writes.
Angular (Front-end application framework) – Handles Client and Server Requests
Node.js (JavaScript runtime environment) – Accepts requests and displays results to end user
